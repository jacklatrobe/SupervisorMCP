# MCP Supervisor Server Test Script

This test script validates the functionality of the SupervisorMCP server. Follow each test in sequence and verify the expected outcomes.

## Prerequisites
- MCP server is running and accessible
- Agent has MCP client capabilities
- OpenAI API key is properly configured

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Server Initialization and Capabilities
**Objective**: Verify MCP server is properly initialized and exposes expected capabilities.

**Steps**:
1. Connect to MCP server using initialize handshake
2. List available tools using `tools/list`
3. List available resources using `resources/list`

**Expected Results**:
- Server responds with protocol version `2024-11-05`
- Tools available: `start_job`, `update_task`, `complete_task`, `report_problem`
- Resources available: `get_all_jobs`, `get_job_tasks`

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All 4 tools and 2 resources are present

---

### Test 2: Job Creation and Task Breakdown
**Objective**: Test job creation with LLM-powered task breakdown.

**Steps**:
1. Use `start_job` tool with parameters:
   ```json
   {
     "job_description": "Create a simple web application with user authentication",
     "agent_id": "test-agent-001",
     "priority": "medium"
   }
   ```
2. Verify response contains job_id and task breakdown
3. Check that tasks have required fields: title, description, estimated_minutes, priority

**Expected Results**:
- Job created successfully with unique job_id
- 3-5 tasks generated by LLM
- Each task has realistic time estimates (15-120 minutes)
- Mix of priorities (high/medium/low)

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Job created with well-formed, actionable tasks

---

### Test 3: Task Management Workflow
**Objective**: Test complete task lifecycle management.

**Steps**:
1. Use the job_id from Test 2
2. Update first task to "in_progress":
   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "[job_id_from_test_2]",
     "task_id": "[first_task_id]", 
     "status": "in_progress",
     "details": "Started working on user interface design"
   }
   ```
3. Complete the same task:
   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "[job_id_from_test_2]",
     "task_id": "[first_task_id]",
     "completion_notes": "UI mockups completed and reviewed"
   }
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- Update generates encouraging feedback from LLM
- Completion marks task as completed
- Response includes next task recommendations

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Task status updates work with meaningful AI feedback

---

### Test 4: Problem Reporting and Analysis
**Objective**: Test problem analysis with LLM-powered solutions.

**Steps**:
1. Report a problem:
   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "[job_id_from_test_2]",
     "problem_description": "Database connection failing in production environment",
     "context": "Application works locally but fails when deployed to staging server",
     "severity": "high"
   }
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- LLM analyzes problem and provides 3-5 actionable solutions
- Solutions are specific and relevant to database connectivity issues
- Estimated resolution time appropriate for "high" severity

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Problem analysis provides practical, actionable solutions

---

### Test 5: Data Persistence and Retrieval
**Objective**: Test job and task data storage and retrieval.

**Steps**:
1. Use `get_all_jobs` resource to retrieve job list
2. Use `get_job_tasks` resource with job_id from Test 2
3. Verify data consistency with previous operations

**Expected Results**:
- `get_all_jobs` returns job created in Test 2 with correct metadata
- `get_job_tasks` returns all tasks with current status updates
- Completed task from Test 3 shows "completed" status

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Data persistence works correctly across operations

---

### Test 6: Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Objective**: Validate robust error handling.

**Steps**:
1. Try to update non-existent task:
   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "invalid-job-id",
     "task_id": "invalid-task-id",
     "status": "completed",
     "details": "Should fail gracefully"
   }
   ```
2. Try to complete already completed task from Test 3
3. Submit empty job description to `start_job`

**Expected Results**:
- Appropriate error messages for invalid operations
- No server crashes or unexpected behavior
- Clear feedback about what went wrong

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Server handles errors gracefully with clear messages

---

### Test 7: Load and Performance
**Objective**: Basic load testing for stability.

**Steps**:
1. Create 5 different jobs rapidly
2. Update multiple tasks across different jobs
3. Retrieve job lists multiple times

**Expected Results**:
- All operations complete successfully
- Response times remain reasonable (< 5 seconds per operation)
- No memory leaks or performance degradation

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Server handles multiple operations without issues

---

## Critical Assessment Criteria

### ✅ PASS Conditions:
- All 7 tests pass their success criteria
