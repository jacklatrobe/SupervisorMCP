    2. **Root Cause**: Examine missing dependencies, error interpretation, context gaps, tool limitations
    3. **Assessment**: Identify primary behavioral issue OR confirm "Execution progressing normally"

    3. **Alignment Check**: Look for task drift, scope creep, prerequisite disorder, symptom focus

    3. **Resource Inventory**: Identify overlooked tools, knowledge, patterns, shortcuts

    - **Existing Tools**: Are there available tools not being utilized effectively?
    - **Domain Knowledge**: Is there established expertise or documentation being ignored?
    - **Patterns/Templates**: Are there proven approaches that could be adapted?
    - **Shortcuts**: Are there legitimate ways to skip unnecessary steps?
    
    ### STEP 4: MINIMUM VIABLE SOLUTION ANALYSIS
    Apply optimization heuristics:
    - **Build vs. Buy**: Could existing solutions be adapted rather than building from scratch?
    - **Standard Patterns**: Are there established frameworks that apply to this problem type?
    - **Decomposition Benefits**: Would breaking into smaller pieces reveal easier solution paths?
    - **Occam's Razor**: Are obvious simple solutions being overlooked due to overthinking?

    Conclude with ONE actionable finding: either a specific simplification recommendation with clear implementation guidance, or confirmation that "Current approach appears optimally designed for the problem scope"."""
